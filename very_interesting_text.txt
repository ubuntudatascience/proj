This is an extremely interesting text.
This is the result to he work of George
and Devan.

Meanwhile Devan calls up George. Devan 
tells him he will improve this part of the text, 
he will do this on a different branch so that he 
will not interfere with Georgeâ€™s work.
*PLACE HOLDER: Devan HAS A CRUCIAL IMPROVEMENT*

George suddenly realises that there is a 
very nice text, that copes very nicely with 
what Devan is about to write. This is why 
he is creating a new branch and writing 
his text here. 
*PLACE HOLDER: George'S TEXT*

Before merging the two branches, George
writes a very nice conclusion for the document
and commits it.
*PLACE HOLDER: (George or Devan)'S TEXT*
